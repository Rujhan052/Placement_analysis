Placement Analysis Project
Overview

This project looks at student placement data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The idea was simple: clean the raw dataset, ask the right questions using SQL, and then build dashboards in Power BI to see the patterns more clearly.

What I Did:
1) Used Excel to clean and prepare the dataset.
   
2) Wrote SQL queries to answer questions like:
     How many companies came for SDE roles vs Analyst roles?

     How many students were placed at different CGPA levels?

     What was the average CTC across different roles?

3) Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize placements by role, company, CGPA, and CTC.

Tools:
1) Excel for data cleaning
2) MySQL for querying
3) Power BI for visualization


Key Findings:

1) More companies visited for SDE roles compared to Analyst roles.
2) Students with higher CGPAs had a better chance of getting placed.
3) Average CTC was higher for SDE roles than Analyst roles.
4) The number of students placed closely followed the CGPA distribution.
