Placement Analysis Project
Overview:
This project looks at student placement data using Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The idea was simple: clean the raw dataset, ask the right questions using SQL, and then build dashboards in Power BI to see the patterns more clearly.

Why This Project?
Placement analysis is something every student and college talks about, but most of the time the data stays scattered in Excel sheets or reports. This project makes it structured and visual so that:
   1) Students can understand what matters (e.g., CGPA, role types).
   2) Colleges can identify trends and prepare better.
   3) Anyone can explore the placement outcomes interactively through Power BI dashboards.

What I Did:
1) Used Excel to clean and prepare the dataset.
2) Wrote SQL queries to answer questions like:
     How many companies came for SDE roles vs Analyst roles?
     How many students were placed at different CGPA levels?
     What was the average CTC across different roles?
3) Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize placements by role, company, CGPA, and CTC.

Process
1) Data Cleaning (Excel)
   Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns.
   Handled missing values.
   Standardized fields like CTC (salary) to a single format (LPA).
   Added calculated fields such as Offer Type (Internship / Full-time / PPO).

2) Querying (MySQL)
   Some key queries I worked on:
   Count of companies that visited for SDE vs Analyst roles.
   Number of students placed by CGPA range.
   Average and maximum CTC offered per role.
   Total number of offers vs accepted offers.

3) Visualization (Power BI)
   Built dashboards with the following insights:
   Placement distribution by role – SDE, Analyst, others.
   Students placed by CGPA bracket – clear trend of higher CGPA = more placements.
   CTC analysis – average salaries across different roles.
   Company contribution – which companies recruited the most students.

Tools:
1) Excel for data cleaning
2) MySQL for querying
3) Power BI for visualization

Key Findings:
1) More companies visited for SDE roles compared to Analyst roles.
2) Students with higher CGPAs had a better chance of getting placed.
3) Average CTC was higher for SDE roles than Analyst roles.
4) The number of students placed closely followed the CGPA distribution.
